# Apple-Charging-Station

This .STL file is a charging station for the Apple Watch, the iPhone X, and the AirPods. The only thing left to add are the charging cables. The rectangular hole is used as a tray for keys/coins.

Note that this design is designed to be placed over a platform (I chose a wooden platform). That way all of the cables come out of the same hole in the platform.
